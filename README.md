# Reflection

A small package that provides a Swift API for instantiating Swift and Objective-C classes by their non-namespaced class name.

# Installation
## Swift Package Manager

The Swift Package Manager is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Reflection as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/pleasesavemycat/Reflection.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
]
```
